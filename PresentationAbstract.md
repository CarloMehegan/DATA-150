Abstract: Over the last century and a half, the percentage of Indian citizens with access to the internet has increased from 4% to 50%. The number of internet users in India has grown to encompass a group over twice as large as the entire population of the US. This rapid growth, backed by legislation and funding from global tech leaders, has opened people in India to new opportunities and changed how the country consumes media. In this presentation, I explore how this rapid digitization has affected Indian peoples and speculate on how India's new online audience could affect how people around the world consume media.
